# Template Generator

Command line tool for generating my competitive programming templates. For
this script to work ensure that you have a folder called `templates` in a parent
directory. If no such folder exists then this script in its current state will
enter an infinite loop. Checkout my [Competitive Programming Templates](https://github.com/BrandonPacewic/CompetitiveProgrammingProblems/tree/mega/templates)
for an example of what your `templates` folder should look like relative to where
you keep the rest of your problems.
